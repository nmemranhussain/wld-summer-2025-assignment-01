# Project Description of 'US Unemployment Analysis'

This project analyzes historical monthly US unemployment rates from 1948 to the present. Using Python and Jupyter notebooks, we explore trends, identify economic peaks and troughs, and visualize long-term patterns in employment.

# US Unemployment Data Analysis

This project investigates historical unemployment trends in the United States using monthly data from the Federal Reserve (1948â€“present). It applies core data analysis techniques using Python and Jupyter in a virtual environment managed by **UV**, providing insight into economic cycles, policy impacts, and employment stability.

## ðŸ”§ Virtual Environment Setup (PowerShell 7)

1. Install UV (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex

2. Install Python 3.12:
   uv python install 3.12

3. Create and activate virtual environment:
   mkdir business-data-analysis
   cd business-data-analysis
   uv venv --python 3.12
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

4. Install required packages:
   uv pip install pandas matplotlib ipykernel jupyter

5. Register the Jupyter kernel:
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=business-analysis --display-name="Business Analysis (UV)"

6. Generate requirements.txt:
   uv pip freeze > requirements.txt

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   Open and run unemployment_analysis.ipynb.

2. Open and run unemployment_analysis.ipynb.

3. To run the .py script version:
   python unemployment_analysis.py

## Key Findings
Lowest unemployment: 2.5% in May 1953
Highest unemployment: 14.8% in April 2020 (COVID-19)
Highest average annual unemployment: 9.71% in 1982
Most stable decade: 1990s with the lowest standard deviation
Recent trend: Unemployment dropped post-COVID and stabilized around 4% by 2025
